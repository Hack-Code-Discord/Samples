Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of 
recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so the person 
using the keyboard is unaware their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved 
by the person operating the logging program. 

The keylogger in this repository is implemented in C#. It captures low level key events and does not require focus or even a graphical user interface.
