Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of 
recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that a person 
using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved 
by the person operating the logging program. 

The keylogger implementation in this repository is implemented in C#, it captures low level key events,
it does not require focus, or even a graphical user interface.
